		<h1>About Me</h1>
		</div>

		<p>Welcome to my page! My name is Brianne, or Bri for short. I am the proud mom of three and wife to a pretty awesome guy.</p>

		<p>My husband began studying Information Technology a few years ago. At first, watching him code was nearly overwhelming. I said to him once, "it is like looking at a whole other written language and I cannot read this craziness". Little did I know, it actually <strong>IS</strong> another language! If there is anything that gets under my skin, it is not understanding something. For my own sanity, I started tinkering with coding so I could try to understand it a bit. What I did not expect was to fall nearly instantly in love! There is something simply magical about the idea of having a completely blank canvas to create literally anything the mind can imagine. My hand-eye coordination leaves much to be desired (and boy do I wish I was exaggerating that sad fact). Coding is the creative outlet I have always craved.</p>

		<p>Aside from my potentially unhealthy level of obsession with trying to devour as much coding knowledge as possible, I also an avid reader. I aspire to have enough guts to one day write one of the many novels that have, so far, only been given life in my head. My love for words and flowy language is enormous.It is the form of art that speaks to my soul most. </p>

		<p><s>If you enjoy watching people fall flat on their face as they</s>  If you want to follow an optimistic dreamer on her quest to learn and improve her coding abilities and receive updates to your inbox, I invite you to enter your information into the little boxes below. I welcome any and all feedback, critiques, and helpful tips from fellow code lovers and will also happily review and provide feedback on any code you may have!</p>

		<!-- Insert "follow me" submission forms -insert a quote - then insert a place for people to leave comments - add footer to page with date created or whatever info goes there; do I want to segment off more?
